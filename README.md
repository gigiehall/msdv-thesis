### Abstract

Los Angeles is inextricably tied to water — the city’s founding and expansion is famously attached to a series of water wars that continue on today for a number of reasons. LA imports 85% of its water through three major aqueducts, all of which are vulnerable to leaks, evaporation, and natural disaster. On the latter issue, reports state that there is a 75% chance one or more M7.0 or greater earthquakes will strike Southern California in the next thirty years. Because these aqueducts collectively cross the San Andreas fault 32 times, a major Earthquake would have catastrophic effects on LA’s water supply. Yet most Angelenos are unaware of where their water comes from, paying most attention to this precious resource when historic droughts force residents to stop watering their lawns and water costs go up. And who could blame Angelenos for this disconnect when they rely on an elaborate state-run system to convey their water from hundreds of miles away? What can be done by individuals and communities to tackle this crisis and revitalize the city’s local water supply? 

By showing how LA became so vulnerable and what could happen if an Earthquake struck, my aim is not to ring the alarmist bell, but to provide a prediction model that spurs interest in community resilience rather than short term disaster preparedness. As environmental reporter Emily Green said, “an important element of managing the local water supply involves maintaining a ‘water ethic’ so that people know where their water comes from.” I believe nature-based, design, and arts driven initiatives can provide a pathway for individuals and communities to actively participate in this water ethic and directly address this crisis.

### Introduction
Los Angeles has a long, impressive, and contentious water history. The city’s expansion was made possible by the incredible engineering that William Mulholland deployed to build the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, which to this day, carries approximately 430,000 acre-feet of water every year to Los Angeles, largely by gravity alone. But that water comes from hundreds of miles away, first as snowpack in the Eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains, melting, making its way to the Owens Valley, and then traveling 233 miles before it reaches drought-ridden Los Angeles. The famous water wars featured in Polanksi’s “Chinatown” were fought over land and water rights in the high desert, which paved the way for the aqueduct’s construction and the diversion of the region's water. A once verdant Owens Valley turned into a dust bowl so that LA could maintain its existence. 

But LA faces both water scarcity and seismic activity. The LA Aqueduct, along with the Colorado River and California Aqueducts supply LA with 85% of its water, and all are vulnerable to leaks, evaporation, and natural disaster. Collectively, the aqueducts cross the San Andreas fault 32 times and reports state that there is a 75% chance one or more M7.0 or greater earthquakes will strike Southern California in the next 30 years. A serious seismic event would cause major infrastructure damage, water contamination, and supply chain issues. 

Yet, given the significant history and severity of the issue today, most Angelenos are unaware of where their water comes from, paying most attention to this precious resource when historic droughts force residents to stop watering their lawns and water costs go up. And who could blame Angelenos for this disconnect when they rely on an elaborate state-run system to convey their water from hundreds of miles away? 

By showing how LA became so vulnerable, what could happen if an Earthquake struck, and what can be done now, my aim is to spur interest in community resilience rather than short term disaster preparedness. Through a nature based lens, this thesis will explore how design interventions, such as interactive maps, visual simulations, and public arts initiatives, can empower communities and individuals to become active participants in water conservation and stewardship. As environmental reporter Emily Green said, “an important element of managing the local water supply involves maintaining a ‘water ethic’ so that people know where their water comes from.” By bridging the gap between science, design, and culture, I hope to contribute to this “water ethic” and the shift towards a more resilient water future for Los Angeles.
