### Abstract

Los Angeles is inextricably tied to water — the city’s founding and expansion is famously attached to a series of water wars that continue on today for a number of reasons. LA imports 85% of its water through three major aqueducts, all of which are vulnerable to leaks, evaporation, and natural disaster. On the latter issue, reports state that there is a 75% chance one or more M7.0 or greater earthquakes will strike Southern California in the next thirty years. Because these aqueducts collectively cross the San Andreas fault 32 times, a major Earthquake would have catastrophic effects on LA’s water supply. Yet most Angelenos are unaware of where their water comes from, paying most attention to this precious resource when historic droughts force residents to stop watering their lawns and water costs go up. And who could blame Angelenos for this disconnect when they rely on an elaborate state-run system to convey their water from hundreds of miles away? What can be done by individuals and communities to tackle this crisis and revitalize the city’s local water supply? 

By showing how LA became so vulnerable and what could happen if an Earthquake struck, my aim is not to ring the alarmist bell, but to provide a prediction model that spurs interest in community resilience rather than short term disaster preparedness. As environmental reporter Emily Green said, “an important element of managing the local water supply involves maintaining a ‘water ethic’ so that people know where their water comes from.” I believe nature-based, design, and arts driven initiatives can provide a pathway for individuals and communities to actively participate in this water ethic and directly address this crisis.
